# Release Procedures

The release procedures below can be performed by a project member with
"maintainer" or higher privileges on the GitHub repository. They assume
that you will be working in an up-to-date local clone of the GitHub
repository, where the `upstream` remote points to
`github.com/apptainer/apptainer`.

There are two different release procedures:

* A new patch release, e.g. releasing 1.1.9 when the current release is 1.1.8,
  follows a short procedure that can be completed within a day.
* A new major or minor version, e.g. releasing 1.2.0 when the current release
  is 1.1.8, requires a longer procedure that takes a minimum of 2 weeks. This
  includes a release candidate period, creation of a new release branch, new
  documentation branches etc.

## Patch Releases

A patch release is made from an existing `release-XXX` branch, to provide fixes
for the current stable major.minor version of Apptainer.

### Prior to Patch Release

1. Set a target date for the patch release.
1. Use a GitHub milestone to track issues and PRs that will form part of the
   patch release.
1. Cherry pick fixes from the `main` branch onto the `release-XXX` branch.
1. Ensure that the `CHANGELOG.md` is kept up-to-date on the `release-XXX`
   branch, with all relevant changes listed under a "Changes Since Last Release"
   section.
1. Identify and manually test any changes that are not exercised by the CI
   pipeline. E.g. cgroups v1 code.

### Creating the Patch Release

1. Modify the `INSTALL.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` via PR against the
   release branch, so that they reflect the version to be released. Also modify
   Go version mentioned in `INSTALL.md`, if that has changed since last release.
1. After all PRs are merged, apply an annotated tag to the HEAD of the release
   branch via `git tag -a -m "Apptainer v1.1.9" v1.1.9`.
1. Push the tag to the GitHub repository via `git push upstream v1.1.9`.
1. Create a GitHub release, using the previous release as a guide and
   incorporating `CHANGELOG.md` information.
1. Notify the community about the release via the Google Group and Slack.

### After the Patch Release

1. Create and merge a PR from the `release-XXX` branch into `main`, so that the
   changelog is synchronized etc.

## Major / Minor Releases

A Major release (e.g. 1.1 -> 2.0), or minor release (e.g. 1.1 -> 1.2)
requires a minimum of two weeks to complete. This allows time for feedback on at
least one release candidate to be received from the user community.

### Prior to Release

1. Set a target date for the release candidate (if required) and release.
   Generally 2 weeks from RC -> release is appropriate for new 1.X minor
   versions. A major release may need a longer RC period.
1. Aim to specifically discuss the release timeline and progress in community
   meetings at least 2 months prior to the scheduled date.
1. Use a GitHub milestone to track issues and PRs that will form part of the
   next release.
1. Ensure that the `CHANGELOG.md` is kept up-to-date on the `main` branch,
   with all relevant changes listed under a "Changes Since Last Release"
   section.
1. Monitor and merge dependabot updates, such that a release is made with as
   up-to-date versions of dependencies as possible. This lessens the burden in
   addressing patch release fixes that require dependency updates, as we use
   several dependencies that move quickly.

### Creating the Release Branch and Release Candidate

When a new major or minor version of Apptainer is issued the release
process begins by branching, and then issuing, a release candidate for
broader testing.

1. From a repository that is up-to-date with the `main` branch, create a release
   branch e.g. `git checkout upstream/main -b release-1.2`.
1. Push the release branch to the GitHub repository via `git push upstream
   release-1.2`.
1. Examine the GitHub branch protection rules, to extend them to the
   new release branch if needed.  Also examine `.github/dependabot.yml`
   to see if the new branch should be added there.
1. Update the `.github/dependabot.yml` configuration so that dependabot is
   tracking the new stable release branch. Do not remove the previous stable
   release branch from the configuration yet, as it should be monitored until
   the final release of a new version.
1. Modify the `INSTALL.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` via PR against
   the release branch, so that they reflect the release candidate version to be
   issued. Also modify Go version mentioned in `INSTALL.md`, if that has changed
   since last release.
1. Apply an annotated tag via
   `git tag -a -m "Apptainer v1.2.0 Release Candidate 1" v1.2.0-rc.1`.
1. Push the tag via `git push upstream v1.2.0-rc.1`.
1. Create a GitHub pre-release, using the previous release as a guide and
   incorporating `CHANGELOG.md` information. Make sure it is clear to use
1. Notify the community about the release candidate via the announce Google Group
   and Slack #general channel.

There will often be multiple release candidates issued prior to the final
release of a new major or minor version. Each new RC follows step 5 and above.

### Creating a Final Major / Minor Release

1. Ensure the user and admin documentation is up-to-date for the new
   version, has been branched, and tagged.
   * [User Docs](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/) can be
     edited [here](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer-userdocs).
     Be sure that the `apptainer_source` submodule is up to date by
     doing the following commands followed by making an update with
     a pull request:
      * `git submodule deinit -f .`
      * `git submodule update --init`
      * `cd apptainer_source`
      * `git fetch`
      * `git checkout v1.2.0-rc.1`
      * `cd ..`
      * `git add apptainer_source`
   * [Admin Docs](https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/) can be
     edited [here](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer-admindocs)
   * Look in replacements.py in both the User Docs and Admin Docs for
     any needed updates to the `variable_replacements` and also update
     `version` in conf.py.
   * If a new branch was created, add it to the docsVersion list in the
     [web page](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer.org/blob/master/src/pages/docs.js)
1. Ensure the user and admin documentation has been deployed to the
   apptainer.org website.
1. Modify the `INSTALL.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` via PR against
   the release-1.Y branch, so that they reflect the version to be released. Also
   modify Go version mentioned in `INSTALL.md`, if that has changed since last
   release.
1. Apply an annotated tag via `git tag -a -m "Apptainer v1.2.0" v1.2.0`.
1. Push the tag via `git push upstream v1.2.0`.
1. Create a GitHub release, using the previous release as a guide and
   incorporating `CHANGELOG.md` information. Attach the tarball, rpms, debs, and
   `sha256sums` to it.
1. Notify the community about the release candidate via the announce Google Group
   and the Slack #general channel.

### After the Release

1. Create and merge a PR from the `release-XXX` branch into `main`, so that
   history from the RC process etc. is captured on `main`.
1. Update the `.github/dependabot.yml` configuration to remove the prior stable
   release branch.
1. Start scheduling / setting up milestones etc. to track the next release!
